"gone through your work, that was also very great, you even tried the PCA analysis and executed it perfectly, all your models well well done so I think we shall now:
Work with NLP (text classification) here especially what you need to learn is text  to vectors conversion (text vectorization)
 Learn dummy variables, what they are and how to implement them in python.
Learn more about PCA analysis ( what it does- compress information ) and when to apply it on ML (its a form of data cleaning especially when you want to visualize data with a lot of columns and or want to use fewer columns in your ML but still want to retail most of the information.)
Learn more about  Hyperparameter tuning
Learn more about data preprocessing for machine learning and variable enriching/addition
Learn to ensemble models -  simple ensembles and more complex ones
Once you have gone through all this we shall be on the same level as data scientists.(I will send you a simple question that will teach you dummy variables applications and tomorrow ill teach you text  ML)",not_spam
"This is really good, I especially liked how you used the map function to transform the location to numeric. This is called ""Label encoding"" and it's one of the many ways s you can convert a factor into numeric, the other way is through dummy variables, you normally try both and see which has the best output. I see also you used all the models that I trained you and this is very impressive and well-executed . You have put in a lot of time in this and its much evident, great work.",not_spam
"Recently I asked Alex to do a household survey on the rent-related dataset. The data he collected was on a few characteristics of houses for rent and their respective rent amounts. The data below  is what he collected, the data was quite messy so i want you to do the following:
read the data
clean the data( remove the outliers and make sure all of X is numeric)
do an EDA for the data
Y =  rent, based on the other characteristics
Try other models other than baseline models
Do 1 Hyperparameter tuning
improve data cleaning and see if that helps improve your model

"2020 F1 Esports Pro Series
Round Four ReportRound Recap
The BWT Racing Point F1 Esports Team demonstrated its focus on improving qualifying form had paid off with an incredible first podium of the 2020 season for Daniele Haddad. 

Daniele made it through to Q3 at Suzuka, while Lucas was unlucky to go out in Q1 in P18, and Daniele’s superb lap in Q3 earned P3 on the grid.  

Daniele made a strong start when the lights went out to hold onto P3 and he had the pace to match the leading duo, but he wisely opted to hold position and build a buffer to score the team’s best result of the campaign. 

There was sharp work on the pitwall too with a perfectly timed pitstop on Lap 7 of 19 proving crucial in holding off rivals attempting overcuts and undercuts.

Further back, Lucas continued to demonstrate his strong race pace in 2020, climbing five places to finish in P13 and within reaching distance of the points as he and the team made the alternate strategy of Medium to Softs work.

Mexico continued the trend of improved qualifying form for Daniele who made it to P7 on the grid, while Lucas lined up in P19. 

A strong start for the Italian went unrewarded after the leading pack tangled and spun, forcing Daniele off the track before a rival turned in on him as he re-joined the track.

A resulting damaged front wing left Daniele playing damage limitation and he put in a superb spell of defensive driving by leading a DRS train after an early pitstop on Lap 9 of 25. 

But tyre wear told in the late stages, dropping him to P15 – while Lucas ran in points contention until a spin in the stadium section left him P19. 

He would charge back up to P12 with seven superb overtakes, falling narrowly short of points. 

The season-ending race in Brazil proved a challenging affair with Lucas qualifying in P18 ahead of Daniele in P20. 

While Lucas made up an incredible six places in the first three laps, he was only able to take P15 at the flag, while Daniele was P16 after a long-running first stint on the Mediums that couldn’t help him gain places through strategy.
In Words
Lucas Blakeley
“First of all, I want to say congratulations to Dani for the podium, it was a great drive. For me, Event Four was a tough way to end the season and qualifying was particularly difficult for me. It was fine margins as it has been throughout the Event. I don’t think I performed as well as I could in Japan and Mexico, I just made too many mistakes in qualifying and it put me on the backfoot, despite being able to make progress through the field. We just couldn’t quite get consistent performance out of the car. I gave it everything in the race in Brazil and there wasn’t much more I could do than P12. We just couldn’t quite keep the car and tyre performance up at the final stage, which is why we dropped to P15. It’s not been the season I wanted. I’ve had some good moments and some bad moments and now I’ll go away and review them and make sure I learn and improve. I’m determined to come back stronger.”
Daniele Haddad
“I’m delighted to have got a podium at Suzuka, we all did an excellent job. We started in P3 and we were able to keep close to the cars ahead. I stayed in touch throughout but I looked at the bigger picture and decided not to take risks because it’s really important to score a good amount of points in the Constructors’ Championship and demonstrate how much we’ve improved since Event Three. We were able to improve our Qualifying form and P7 in Mexico was a good result and further proof of that. Sadly, after making a good start, there was a collision in front of me at Turn 1 and to avoid it I went off track and when I re-joined someone turned into me and broke my front wing. It was gutting because I think we had a good chance of getting a top five result. It was then a tough way to end the season in Brazil, I’m disappointed with the result. We worked hard to make progress through the field, but we just didn’t get it together to fight for the points. Regardless of the ups and downs, I want to thank everyone in the team for their work this season. It’s been challenging, but we’ve given it everything and supported each other every step of the way. I’m very grateful.”
Shanaka Clay
“I’m very grateful to the team for giving me the opportunity to make my debut in the F1 Esports Pro Series this year. It hasn’t been the campaign me or the team would have wanted, but it’s been an honour. On my side, I think it’s clear that there are improvements to be made in qualifying because it’s proven to be crucial to a good result in the races. While it hasn’t always been easy, it’s given me huge motivation to come back stronger and to work hard on improving in every area.”",spam
